# MovieMinds - Content based Movie Recommender System using Machine Learning

**MovieMinds** is a smart movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques. It leverages user preferences, movie ratings, and other key features to suggest movies that match individual tastes. Whether you're looking for your next blockbuster or an underrated gem, MovieMinds has you covered.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
- ML algorithms such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- Ability to suggest movies from various genres, actors, and directors.
- Easy-to-use interface for users to provide movie ratings.
- Scalable architecture to handle large movie datasets.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Flask/Django (for API/Frontend)
- [`TMDB-5000`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) Dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Debargha-Mitra-Roy/MovieMinds.git
   cd MovieMinds
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv <YOUR_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
   source <PATH_TO_YOUR_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT>/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Your movie recommender system will be available at [`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Movie data is collected from sources like the MovieLens dataset or APIs like The Movie Database (TMDb).
2. **Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and necessary feature extraction is performed (e.g., genre, cast, etc.).
3. **Model Building:** The system uses machine learning models like:
   - Collaborative filtering (User-based or Item-based).
   - Content-based filtering.
4. **Recommendation:** The model suggests a list of movies based on the user's input or movie history.

## Usage

- Input your preferences, such as genre, favorite actors, or specific movies you‚Äôve enjoyed.
- The system will recommend a list of movies that match your profile.
- You can also rate movies, and the system will update recommendations accordingly.

## Example

**Input:**

- Preferred Genre: Comedy, Action
- Favorite Actor: Leonardo DiCaprio

**Output:**  
A list of movie recommendations featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in the comedy and action genres.
